All calculations are done using Gauss's law. As such, we assume appropriate symmetries. All cylinders and planes will span the entirety 
of the calculation space to simulate infinitely long cylinders and infinite planes.
The general form of Gauss's law is as follows:
			int(E_vec dot dA_vec) = q_enclosed/epsilon_0


for shell surfaces and planes:
	q_enc = charge/area * area = sigma*A
	A is a function of geometry
		Cylinder: A = 2*pi*radius*length of cylinder
		Sphere: A = 4*pi*radius^2
		Plane: A = the area of a small square on the surface (A will drop out)
	The integral evaluates to the following:
		Cylinder: E*2*pi*radius*length of cylinder
		Shpere: E*4*pi*radius^2
		Plane: E*2*A
The LHS is always a function of r, a variable.
The RHS is always a function of R and sigma. 
	if r<R, sigma = 0
	if r<=R, RHS radius =>constant R 

For solid objects:
	Q_enc = charge/volume * volume = rho*v
	v is a function of geometry
		Cylinder: v = pi*radius^2*length of cylinder
		Sphere: v = 4/3*pi*radius^3
	the integrals evaluate to the same things.
        if r<R, RHS radius => r
        if r<=R, RHS radius => constant R

All V values are the negative integrals of E_vec dot dl_vec from a reference
point to the point we care about

inputs:
center = numpy.array([vector denoting center of object])
radius = radius of object
distribution = charge distribution
axis = numpy.array([vector denoting central axis of cylinder])
normal = numpy.array([vector normal to face of plane])



ChargedSphere(center,radius,distribution)
ChargedSphereShell(center,radius,distribution)
ChargedCylinder(center,axis,radius,distribution)
ChargedCylinderShell(center,axis,radius,distribution)
ChargedPlane(center,distribution,normal)



To use the Superimpose functions, place all the charged objects into one list.
This list is the argument for the superimpose functions

List_of_objects = [X1,X2,X3,...,X_n]
x = numpy.array([position vector for the point you care about])


EFIELD = E_Superposition(List_of_objects,x)
VFIELD = V_Superposition(List_of_objects,x)
